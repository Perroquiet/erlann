{"name":"ERLANN","tagline":"an Neural Network Library for Erlang","body":"### Overview\r\nErlang has been [discussed](http://www.erlang-factory.com/conference/SFBay2011/speakers/GeneSher) as a perfect fit for problems involving neural networks. The structure of a perceptron (neuron) can be represented as a [single Erlang process](https://erlangcentral.org/wiki/index.php/Erlang_and_Neural_Networks) that holds the weights, and connections to neighboring perceptrons. Communication between perceptrons would be realized through message passing. \r\n\r\n![Structure of a Neural Network](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-W-5ZqNNXa2Y/UnD1gNWEHLI/AAAAAAAAAmk/kDsnsLkBoao/s469/NNddd.png)\r\n\r\nDuring the feedforward operation, each perceptron only takes the inputs and weights of the previous layer to calculate for its output. This would imply that the perceptrons in a particular layer does not share data with each other, ergo, the calculation of each perceptron can be done _concurrently_. \r\n\r\nA neural network library for Erlang is then introduced that follows a similar methods with the [Fast Artificial Neural Network (FANN)](leenissen.dk) library. The library automates the creation and execution of the neural network and utilizes an Erlang process to monitor the neural network's configuration (Inputs, Hidden, Output layers).\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nClone the repository on Github: <br/>\r\n`$ git clone https://github.com/Perroquiet/erlann.git`<br/>\r\nYou may view the full documentation of the library through <br/>\r\n`/edoc/index.html`\r\n\r\n### Library Specifications\r\n* **Data Pre-processing:** Log Normalization\r\n* **Activation Function:** Sigmoid Function\r\n* **Learning Algorithm:** Backpropagation\r\n* **Training Sequence:** Training -> Testing -> Error Evaluation\r\n* **Evaluation Criteria:** Mean Squared Prediction Error (MSPE)\r\n\r\n### References\r\n* [Erlang and Neural Networks by Wil Chung](https://erlangcentral.org/wiki/index.php/Erlang_and_Neural_Networks)\r\n* [From Telecom Networks to Neural Networks; Erlang, as the unintentional Neural Network Programming Language By Gene Sher](http://www.erlang-factory.com/conference/SFBay2011/speakers/GeneSher)\r\n* [Fast Artificial Neural Network (FANN) Library](http://leenissen.dk/)\r\n\r\n### License\r\nGNU GPL v3\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nMSU - Iligan Institute of Technology <br/>\r\nAndres Bonifacio Avenue, Tibanga, 9200 Iligan City, Philippines <br/>\r\ndaniellitojr.padayhag@g.msuiit.edu.ph <br/>\r\nkevin.reyes@g.msuiit.edu.ph <br/>\r\nibrahim.gamoranao@g.msuiit.edu.ph  ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
